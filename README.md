# Test Task

My solution of the ITS Partners task. It's was intresting to do this :)

## Requirements

All dependensies you can find in requirements.txt, but if you lazy, (like me), you list is [here](https://github.com/Kung-Fu-Stalin/test-task/blob/master/requirements.txt):
```
certifi==2018.4.16
chardet==3.0.4
idna==2.6
requests==2.18.4
urllib3==1.22
```
I use virtualenv:
```
sudo pip install virtualenv
source [path_to_project]/env/bin/activate
```
and then:
```
pip install -r [path_to_requirements]/requirements.txt
```
you should know path to requirements.txt, obviously.
